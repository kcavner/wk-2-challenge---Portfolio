## Description
- This is my professional portfolio. I needed a page to show to employers not only my previous deployments, but my ability to create a portfolio that features a clean, modern design, and an intuitive interface to browse through my work. 

## Details
- On the main page, the user is shown a recent picture of me, and a short intro with a section about my background. I designed it in a way that guides the viewers eyes and brings them from point to point in a way that is intended. My picture, short intro, about me, my deployments; in that order. The page is also designed with good color harmony so that it strikes a balance betweeen easy to distinguish and is nice on the eyes. 

## What it solves
- The page solves the need for a portfolio that grabs the attention of employers, conveys my specific abilities, and ensures a full viewing of my deployments due to my best deployment being featured front and center.

## What i learned
- I learned a lot about making apps responsive, and rules of css properties. I used a lot of viewport percentage widths and heights to make sure things scale with sizing of the screen. I initially designed the page with mobile in mind and i found it was very efficient to make a media query 'working-up' for desktop.
